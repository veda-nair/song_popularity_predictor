## Song popularity predictor using KNN

## Background of the project
Are there certain characteristics for hit songs, what are the largest influencers on a songâ€™s success, and can old songs even predict the popularity of new songs?

I just wanted to analyze the behavior between valence and all the measures that Spotify API gives so I got approximately 10,000 per genre. There are 26 genres so it is a total of 232,725 tracks.

During this project we will predict what factors affect the popularity of the song. We used k nearest neighbours for this analysis. 

Each step of the project is explained with the code.

### Defination of k nearest neighbours algorithm: 
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
